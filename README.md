- In this example project, I analyze a dataset containing player statistics from 5 of Europe's soccer leagues for the 2024-2025 season. The dataset is available on Kaggle, at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hubertsidorowicz/football-players-stats-2024-2025.
- I play the role of a team's (Arsenal) analyst or scout looking for potential goal-scorers for the club to sign in the next transfer window. 
- The Python code features exploring and cleaning data, utilizing for loops, filtering data frames, creating new variables, and visualizating data using matplotlib.
